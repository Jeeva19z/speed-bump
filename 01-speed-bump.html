<title>Speed Bump in JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>A "speed bump" in JavaScript could refer to a technique used to slow down the execution speed of code intentionally. This can be useful in certain scenarios, such as when you want to simulate a delay or throttle the rate at which certain operations are performed.</p>

<h2>Implementation of Speed Bump in JavaScript:</h2>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function performTask() {
    console.log("Task performed.");
}

// Function to introduce a delay (speed bump)
function speedBump() {
    // Simulate a delay using setTimeout
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log("Speed bump over.");
    }, 2000); // 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) delay
}

// Perform task
performTask();

// Introduce a speed bump
speedBump();

// Perform another task after the speed bump
performTask();
</code></pre>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><code>performTask()</code> represents some operation or task that you want to execute.</li>
    <li><code>speedBump()</code> is a function that introduces a delay, acting as a "speed bump" in the execution flow.</li>
    <li>Inside <code>speedBump()</code>, <code>setTimeout()</code> is used to create a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).</li>
    <li>After calling <code>performTask()</code>, <code>speedBump()</code> is invoked, causing a delay before the next task is performed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This delay can be used for various purposes, such as controlling the rate of API requests, simulating network latency, or adding a pause in an animation sequence. It's essentially a way to intentionally slow down the pace of execution in your JavaScript code.</p>
